# Hotel Revenue Project

In this project, I sought out to answer three questions from stakeholders using analysis and visualization tools such as MS SQL Server, Power Query, and Power BI. 


****Question 1: Is our hotel revenue growing by year?****


****Question 2: Should we increase our parking lot size?****


****Question 3: What trends can we see in the data?****
