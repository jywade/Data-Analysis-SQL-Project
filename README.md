# Hotel Revenue Project

In this project, I sought out to answer three questions from stakeholders using analysis and visualization tools such as MS SQL Server, Power Query, and Power BI. 


****Question 1: Is our hotel revenue growing by year?****


****Question 2: Should we increase our parking lot size?****


****Question 3: What trends can we see in the data?****

Pipeline: Built a database, developed the SQL query, connected Power BI to database, visualized data, summarized findings.


I began by uploading the data to MS SQL server and conducting exploratory data analysis in order to find the find the total revenue per year (2018, 2019, 2020).
